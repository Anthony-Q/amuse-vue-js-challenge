# VueJS Code Challenge
## Overview
Amuse is an e-commerce company targeting the cannabis industry in Los Angeles. Your challenge 
is to create the most critical part of the conversion funnel: the category and product detail pages.

Do not spend more than 2-3 hours on the challenge.

## Requirements
- Please fork the repository into your own GitHub account 
- Build a VueJS app on the feature branch
  - The app should have:
    - Category page with product cards with basic product details such as image, name, brand, price
    - Category filter 
  - Nice to have
    - Implement a simple age gate model to confirm that the customer is over 21 years of age 
- Request review from `kenndavila-amuse` and `brandonalmeda` Github users on the finished work 

A sample JSON API response payload is available in this repo for your reference.

Your implementation will be judged on design, using VueJS best practices and 
implementation of the features listed above.

Note: This challenge is intentionally open-ended. Feel free to get creative and 
put your spin on an e-commerce experience.
