# VueJS Code Challenge
## Overview
Amuse is an e-commerce company targeting the cannabis industry in Los Angeles. Your challenge 
is to create the most critical part of the conversion funnel: the category and product detail pages.

Do not spend more than 3-4 hours on the challenge.

## Requirements
- Create a feature branch in this repo off of `master`
- Build a VueJS app on the feature branch
  - The app should have:
    - An age gate requiring the user to be older than 21
    - Category page with product cards, filters and sort options
    - Product page with add to cart button and related products
- Open a Pull Request for the feature branch and request review from `bpleslie` Github user

A sample JSON API response payload is available in this repo for your reference.

Your implementation will be judged on design, using VueJS / PWA best practices and 
implementation of the features listed above.

Note: This challenge is intentionally open-ended. Feel free to get creative and 
put your spin on an e-commerce experience.
